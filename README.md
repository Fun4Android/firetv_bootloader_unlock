========================

Opensource Amazon FireTv Bootloader Unlock Tool

As the title says :)

This was reversed from http://forum.xda-developers.com/fire-tv/orig-development/firetv-partial-bootloader-unlock-t2925891

and I hate closed source things that do things to my systems :)

So far i have it working on a local box. You grab your aboot. patch and resend. 

- Update Android.mk made
- Update Changed into a function type code
- working arm binary (will run directly on the firetv)
- Anyone sees anything else be sure to do a pull request
- 

Also, If anyone wants to make an APK unlock for this! Let me know!!!!!!
