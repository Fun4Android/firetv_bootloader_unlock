========================

Opensource Amazon FireTv Bootloader Unlock Tool

As the title says :)

This was reversed from http://forum.xda-developers.com/fire-tv/orig-development/firetv-partial-bootloader-unlock-t2925891

and I hate closed source things that do things to my systems :)

So far i have it working on a local box. You grab your aboot. patch and resend. 

Need an android build script made for NDK
